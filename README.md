Data and code for the replication of analyses in tough shift

The code should be run in order based on the numbering of ".R" files.

As the iterative procedure for our analysis is time-consuming, figures and tables in the manuscript can be replicated \textit{without} running the iterative procedure by starting at the "03 - figures_tables.R" file.

In order for the read-ins to run smoothly, authors recommend creating an R project containing the repo items.
